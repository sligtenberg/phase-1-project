# Stevo's Snack Sampler

Stevo's Snack Sampler is a vending machine interface, intended to provide a tasteful virtual vending machine experience. The goal is mimic a real-life vending machine for both customer interactions, and maintenance needs.

Use the radio toggle at the top of the page to switch between customer mode and maintenance mode

# Customer mode

In customer mode, a user can insert money in denominations of $5.00 bills, $1.00 bills, quarters, dimes, and nickels, by pressing buttons. The machine should display a live reading of the total value of the money which has been tendered.

The return money button resets the amount tendered to zero.

Once the amount tendered equals or exceeds the cost of a snack, the snack may be purchased, resulting in the snack being displayed in the dispenser, the machine inventory decreasing, and the amount tendered reset to zero.

# Maintenance mode

In maintenance mode, a user can restock the machine with snacks, restock the machine with money, and remove money that the machine has collected.

The check status button will display the current inventory of snacks and money.

The auto reset button will automatically add money and snacks to reset the machine to default values.

After submitting a change to the machine, the machine will print a service record.
